				DATA TYPES
1. None
2. Numeric
3. List[]
4. Tuple()
5. Set{}
6. String""
7. Range
8. Dictionary/Mapping

None: If a variable is not assigned with any value it is none type.
Numeric: It has four types. They are:
1. Int
2. float
3. complex
4. bool

Complex: "J" is used along with variable to be a complex number.
Ex: 6+9j

FLOAT TO INT

a = 5.6
b = int(a)
type(b)

INT TO FLOAT

k = float(b)

NORMAL TO COMPLEX

k = 6
c = complex(b,k)

BOOLEAN: True or False.
int(True) = 1
int(False) = 0

bool = b<k

LIST:
lst = [2,3,4,5,6,7]
type[lst]

SET:
S = {1,2,3,4,5}
type{S}

TUPLE:
t = (1,2,3,4,5)
type(t)

STRING:
str = "srikanth"
Double or single qoutes are used for a string.
In python we do not have character as a data type. We can use character as a path of string.

RANGE:
range(15)
range(0,15)

RANGE TO LIST:
list(range(15))

PICKING ODD NUMBERS:
list(range(3,15,3))

MAPPING/DICTIONARY:

Dictionary is used to fetch data easily by assigning keys. Keys should be unique. 
{} braces are used to not to repeat the keys.


d = {'srikanth':'MI', 'varma': 'Xiaomi', 'cherry' : 'Redmi'}

To know keys:
d.keys()

d.values()

d['srikanth'] o/p: 'mi'
d.get('varma')o/p: 'redmi'
