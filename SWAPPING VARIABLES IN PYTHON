SWAPPING VARIABLES IN PYTHON

a = 5
b = 6

METHOD 1:
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

Here we are using a temp variable to store the data temporarily. So not to waste the variable
and swapping using only two variables we use below two methods.

FORMULA:

a = a+b
b = a-b
a = a-b

METHOD 2:
a = a+b
b = a-b
a = a-b

a = a^b
b = a^b
a = a^b

METHOD 3:
a,b = b,a

Here the right side will be solved first. In this method ROT_TWO concept of rotation is used.
