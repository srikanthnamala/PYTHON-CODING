List has a group of values. Tuple is same as list but it is immutable where as list is mutable.
Set also has a group of values but it does not follows an order.
Set follows the concept of hash.
In python if we create multiple variables with same data they will point to the same reference box which shows the same address.
To know the address the variable type use:
            id('variable')
            If a = 10
            b = a
            If k = 10
            id(k)  Here id of k is same as id of a.
            If a = 9
            id(a)  Here the address is different.
            id(b) Same address as previous because it's pointing to 10.
            If k = a
            id(k) Same as address of a.
            If b = 8
When we have data which is not tagged, it is garbage collected.
Variables are also called as "tags" because we tag a,b,k etc... to 10,9,8.
Constants are denoted by capital letters.
In python there  are no constants.
